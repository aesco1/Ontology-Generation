- `website/`: Houses the WordPress-based testing platform
- `docs/`: Project documentation, technical specifications, and meeting notes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- WordPress development environment
- Ollama framework

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions for both LLM and website components will be provided as development progresses.

## Development Guidelines
